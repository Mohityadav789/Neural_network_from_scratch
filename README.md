# Neural_network_from_scratch

I made this neural network from scratch where I have create data and also did one hot encoding and model selection. This project was made using python and for dataset I uses MNIST dataset to do these tasks and that data was in numeric format not in image so that's why I did model selection and label encoding.

I made this enovation easy..
